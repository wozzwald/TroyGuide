                <h2>1824-1900</h2>
                <p>On November 5th, 1824, Stephen Van Rensselaer established Rensselaer School. Along with the school being established, Reverend Dr. Samuel Blatchford became the first president and Amos Eaton was appointed as the first senior professor. The school officially opened on January 5, 1825. The school was more of a graduate school in its beginning. In 1832, the school was renamed to Rensselaer Institute. The first civil engineering degrees in the US were granted by the school in 1835. Some of the best engineers of the time attended the school. Benjamin Franklin Greene became the new senior professor in 1847. He had previously spent time studying European technical schools and wanted to improve Rensselaer. He reorganized the school into a three-year polytechnic institute. The school consisted of six technical schools at the time too. Finally, in 1861 the school’s name was changed to what it is today, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. In 1862, “The Great Fire” destroyed much of Troy, including RPI. Columbia University proposed a merger with their NYC campus, but it was declined. The campus moved up to the Approach in 1864. </p>

                <h2>1900s</h2>
                <p>The institute’s main building was destroyed once again by a fire in 1904. However, due to President Palmer Ricketts, RPI went through a period of expansion. He added the Department of Arts, Science, and Business Administration, and the Graduate School. He also increased enrollment, increased the number of degrees, and made RPI into a true polytechnic institute. More expansion occurred after World War II. “Freshman Hill” residence was opened in 1953 and the Commons Dining Hall in 1954. In 1961, the Gaerttner Linear Accelerator and Jonsson-Rowland Science Center were constructed.</p>

                <p>On October 3rd, 2008, the Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center (EMPAC) was opened. 2009 also saw the opening of the East Campus Athletics Village (ECAV) and the Blitman Commons residence hall. Other improvements and renovations have been made since then. Today, Martin A. Schmidt is the president.</p>
