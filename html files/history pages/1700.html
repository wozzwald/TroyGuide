                <h2>The Mohican Tribe</h2>
                <p>The first known inhabitants of the land were the Mohican Indian tribe. It is assumed they lived in the area where Troy was for thousands of years. There are two known settlements of the tribe, one where present-day Hoosick Street is, and one on Peebleâ€™s Island.</p>

                <h2>Dutch Settlement and Land Sales</h2>
                <p>The tribe started selling land to the Dutch between 1630 and 1657. The Mohicans ended up selling all their land that made up Troy by 1708. Many of these purchases were made by Kiliaen van Rensselaer, a director of the Dutch West India Company (Rensselaer County is named after him). The land became the patroonship of Rensselaerswyck. The area covered present-day Rensselaer County and most of Albany.</p>

                <h2>Mid 1700s</h2>
                <p>The Dutch West India Company saw much profit in the area due to the fur trade, while van Rensselaer also saw a potential colony that could trade with Europe and South America. One of the early settlements was made by Derick Van der Heyden, where he purchased a farm on the land of present-day Troy. Troy continued to grow due to its role in trading. Troy also supported the Continental Army during the American Revolution with supplies and troops.</p>
