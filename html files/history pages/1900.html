                <h2>20th Century Decline</h2>
                <p>Troy started to decline in the 20th century when the steel industry started to move to Pennsylvania. The collar industry, which Troy was also big in, also began to move away. After Prohibition was passed, the city became a hot spot for illegal alcohol trade from Canada to New York. Gangsters, like “Legs Diamond” also started to run their business through Troy. Like many cities during World War 2, the economy boosted during the war, but started to fall once the industries moved away or closed. Troy lost its manufacturing, was in a population decline, lost its wealth, and had declining infrastructure.</p>

                <h2>Revitalization and "Realize Troy"</h2>
                <p>In 2014, a two-year process called “Realize Troy” was started by the Troy Redevelopment Foundation. Some members of this included RPI, Russell Sage College, and St. Peter’s Health Partners. Now, Troy has been trying to attract tourists and artists, build a downtown and art scene, and revitalize the waterfront. Many people come to still see the architecture. The downtown is growing with many shops, restaurants, and farmers market every weekend.</p>

                <h2>Other Facts</h2>
                <p>In 1900, Lansingburgh was annexed by Troy. It is now the most northern part of Troy. The RPI men’s hockey team, which is D1, has won the NCAA tournament in 1954 and 1985. More recently in 2023, the city completed the first phase of installing two 36-inch pipes between the Tomhannock Reservoir and the Water Treatment Plant.</p>
