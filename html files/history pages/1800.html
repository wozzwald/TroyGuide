                <h2>War of 1812</h2>
                <p>During the War of 1812, Stephen Van Rensselaer of Troy led militia and army forces. Troy was also a strategic location during the war. Supplies were easily shipped through Troy due to its position on the river. The war also helped the city economically. Troy became a place of production for war supplies and other products that usually came from Britain. The War of 1812 is also when the character Uncle Sam came to be. It is said that Uncle Sam was named after a local butcher, Samuel Wilson. Wilson would supply the military with meat barrels that were stamped with “U.S.” which stood for “United States” and “Uncle Sam”. Since then, Troy has claimed to be the home of Uncle Sam.</p>

                <p>In 1824, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute was founded. The institute was sponsored by Stephen Van Rensselaer. RPI also absorbed Troy University after it closed in 1862 during the Civil War. It is the “oldest technological university in the English-speaking world”.</p>

                <h2>Great Fire of 1862</h2>
                <p>On May 11, 1862, a train leaving Troy had sparks coming from the engine. Due to the strong winds, the spark landed on the wooden shingles of the roof of a bridge. The bridge caught on fire, and the heavy winds caused the fire to spread to downtown. Over 3 million dollars of damage was caused, with 500-600 buildings destroyed. RPI was also located downtown at the time, causing the campus to be destroyed.</p>

                <h2>Steel Industry and Industrial Expansion</h2>
                <p>Troy was big in the steel industry. The first American Bessemer converter was made at Wynantskill Creek, located at the south end of the city. When the Erie Canal was complete, it helped with the city’s transportation, trading, and industrial expansion. Later in the 19th century, Troy produced a big part of the steel rails used in the railroad network. Troy Steel Works became one of the leading firms in steel products. Today, there is the Burden Iron Works Museum in South Troy that showcases the industrial past.</p>
