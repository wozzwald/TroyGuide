# Explore Troy

## Background
**Explore Troy** is a web guide to Troy, New York, where information about where to stay, eat, shop, points of interest, and the city's history can be found.

It's created for visitors and new citizens who are not yet familiar with the area and would like to see what Troy has to offer.

Whereas the city government website is mostly about news and services, our website is more interested in history and culture to give it a richer flavor.

This is especially needed since Troy is growing fast and individuals are becoming more interested in residing or visiting the areaâ€”especially with :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} being inside the city.
