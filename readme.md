“Explore Troy”, functions as a tour guide for Troy, providing
information about where to stay, eat, shop, local attractions, and the history of the city. It’s aimed
at prospective visitors and new residents who are unfamiliar with the area and want to explore
what Troy has to offer. Unlike the city government website, which focuses mainly on services
and news, our site dives deeper into the city's culture and history, offering a more engaging
experience. This is especially important as Troy is growing quickly and more people are
interested in living or visiting the area, especially with RPI located in the city.
